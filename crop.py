# =================================================================================================
# Description
# =================================================================================================
# This script creates a new dataset by cropping the edges of an original image dataset by a 
# specified number of pixels.
#
# This is a data preprocessing/augmentation technique primarily used to remove unnecessary borders
# from images like ultrasounds (e.g., black areas displaying equipment information), allowing the 
# model to focus more on the core region of the image during training.
#
# In addition to the images, the script also recalculates and saves the bounding box coordinates
# in the corresponding YOLO format label (.txt) files to match the new, cropped image dimensions.

# =================================================================================================
# Process Flow
# =================================================================================================
# 1. User Input:
#    - When the script is executed, it prompts the user to enter an integer value for the number 
#      of pixels to crop from each edge.
#
# 2. Path Setup and Directory Creation:
#    - The 'Original' folder containing the source data is designated as the source.
#    - A destination directory named '{input_pixels}px_crop' is created to store the results.
#      (e.g., a '10px_crop' folder is created for a 10px crop).
#
# 3. Image and Label Processing (File by File):
#    a. Image Crop:
#       - Loads an original image and crops it from all sides (top, bottom, left, right) by the 
#         number of pixels specified by the user.
#       - Saves the cropped image to the 'images' folder in the destination directory.
#
#    b. Label Recalculation:
#       - Reads the original label file (.txt).
#       - Converts the coordinates of each bounding box to absolute pixel values based on the 
#         original image dimensions.
#       - Since the origin (0,0) has shifted due to cropping, it subtracts the crop pixel value
#         from the bounding box's center coordinates.
#       - These new absolute coordinates are then re-normalized (converted to values between 0 and 1)
#         based on the new dimensions of the cropped image.
#       - The width and height of the bounding box are also re-normalized according to the new image size.
#
#    c. Save New Label:
#       - Saves the new label information with the recalculated coordinates to the 'labels' folder 
#         in the destination directory.
#
# 4. Completion:
#    - After processing all files, it prints a completion message and terminates the script.
